## Game description
Shittape (toilet paper) clicker is a smol clicker game to test **pygame** game engine. I don't think it's worth your time, so play something else :3

## How to run the game
So if you still are curious what tf this is and you want to try it then:
1. Download the zip
2. Extract the folder somewhere
3. Click on the .exe. There's only one so you should know which to click *unless your blind*

If you want to reset your progress then *spanish or vanish* "save.bin" file

## Messing with code
If you want to make your own versions or use my code as a base; sure go on. You will need to install python and then install **pygame** using `pip install pygame`. But if you are here to copy paste the code and treat it as your own I am going to kidnap your balls.
